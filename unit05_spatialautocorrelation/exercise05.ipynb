    "## Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will try to detect *spatial autocorrelation* in the voting behaviour in Denmark.\n",
    "The dataset is from the parliament election in 2022 on the most detailed spatial resolution called 'afstemningsomr√•der' (*voting areas*) (similar to the polygon data set that we used in lecture 4!)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the necessary data in the data subfolder. Read more about the data on the data source: https://valgdatabase.dst.dk/\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set with number of votes for each party in each area does not include the geometries for the area.\n",
    "To plot the election data with the geometries you therefore first need to join the them with a spatial dataset of all voting areas in DK.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset with the geometries is from https://dataforsyningen.dk/ (a very good source to public spatial data in DK).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task I: Get the data ready!\n",
    "\n",
    "To join the two datasets you need to use the columns 'ValgstedId' in the two files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are no geometries in the csv-data, there is no need to reproject the data before joining - but it is still good practice to check the crs and see if it is the one we want.\n",
    "In our case the data is in a specific version of the UTM crs usually used for Denmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data are ready, complete all the other parts required for the ESDA analysis of spatial autocorrelation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure your geography does not have islands (either by removing them or using a method which does not create islands in our data set)\n",
    "- Create a spatial weights matrix\n",
    "- Standardise the spatial weights matrix\n",
    "- Create a standardised version of the data/column you are working with\n",
    "- Create the spatial lag of the number of votes in the voting areas\n",
    "\n",
    "**When creating your spatial weights matrix, think of one criterium to build it that you think would fit this variable (e.g. contiguity, distance-based, etc.), and apply it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The data set on votes in each area contains columns with votes for each party, number of people entitled to vote, etc. You have to choose yourself which part of the data you want to do your analysis on. It might be a good idea to convert all total numbers to percentage.**\n"
