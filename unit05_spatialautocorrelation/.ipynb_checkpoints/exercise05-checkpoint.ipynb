    "In this exercise we will try to detect *spatial autocorrelation* in the voting behaviour in Denmark.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can find the necessary data in the data subfolder. The original data source is https://valgdatabase.dst.dk/\n",

    "- The data set with number of votes for each party in each area does not include the geometries for the area.\n",
    "To plot the election data with the geometries you therefore first need to join the them with a spatial dataset of all voting areas in DK (just like we did in the exercise with LSOAS and the AHAH-index).\n",

    "*Tip: Make sure that the two ID columns have the same length. It might also be a good idea to check for NA/non-matched geometries.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are no geometries in the csv-data, there is no need to reproject the data before joining - but it is still good practice to check the crs and see if it is the one we want.\n",
