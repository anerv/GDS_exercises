    "The AHAH dataset was invented by a University of Liverpool team. If you want to find out more about the background and details of the project, have a look at the [information page](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/access-healthy-assets-hazards-ahah) at the CDRC website.\n",

    "We are going to use the Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards (AHAH) index. This is a score that ranks LSOAs (*see this lesson for an explanation of the LSOA geometries [block B](https://darribas.org/gds_course/content/bB/lab_B.html)*) by the proximity to features of the environment that are considered positive for health (assets) and negative (hazards).  \n",
    "The resulting number gives us a sense of how \"unhealthy\" the environment of the LSOA is. The higher the score, the less healthy the area is assessed to be.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this gets us the geometries of the LSOAs, but not the AHAH data. For that, we need to read in the data and join it to `ahah`. Assuming the same location of the data as above, we can do as follows:\n",
