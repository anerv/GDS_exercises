    "We are going to try to get at the (geographic) essence of New York City. For that, we will rely on the same set up Census tracts for New York City we used for exercise 4 (from the [PySAL examples](https://pysal.org/libpysal/tutorial.html?highlight=examples#example-datasets)). Once you have the `nyc` object loaded, create a geodemographic classification using the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `european`: Population White\n",
    "- `asian`: Population Asian American\n",
    "- `american`: Population American Indian\n",
    "- `african`: Population African American\n",
    "- `hispanic`: Population Hispanic\n",
    "- `mixed`: Population Mixed race\n",
    "- `pacific`: Population Pacific Islander\n",
    "- `otherethni`: Population of other ethnicity\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing the clustering, make sure to standardize these variables (by using percentages instead of absolute numbers). NB: Compute the total population for each tract yourself (do *not* use the \"poptot\" column from the data set as this will lead to discrepancies.) The resulting values should range from 0 (no population of a given ethnic group in that tract) to 1 (all population of that tract is in the given ethnic group). Once this is ready, get to work with the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a number of clusters, N\n",
    "1. Run K-Means for N clusters\n",
    "1. Plot the different clusters on a map\n",
    "1. Analyse the results:\n",
    "    - *What do you find?*\n",
    "    - *What are the main characteristics of each cluster?*\n",
    "    - *How are clusters distributed geographically?*\n",
    "    - *Can you identify some groups concentrated on particular areas (e.g. China Town, Little Italy)?*\n",
    "1. Redo with a different N; how do results depend on the number of chosen clusters?"
